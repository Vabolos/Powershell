### Instructions
To use the files in this folder you will need to do a couple of things:
- Add the `ScriptSelector.ps1` file to the scripts folder (in which all the scripts + aliases are stored)
- Place the `RunScriptSelector.cmd` file on the desktop

If you want to change the locations, you will have to code these into both scripts!

*Both of these scripts are still in the testing phase and need more work before they work properly*
